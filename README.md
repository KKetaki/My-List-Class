This assignment provides you with the opportunity to consolidate your skills,  design, and implement the above concepts in a working program.
System.Collections.Generic.List<T> class is a much used and well documented .NET class. This class is implemented in almost all frameworks. You are encouraged to consult the documentation and develop a thorough understanding of the design and the behaviour of this class. 
In the course of the module, you will learn to ..
-	Build C# console application using .NET Framework. 
-	Investigate an extensively used .NET collection class: System.Collections.Generic.List class
-	Implement your own version of List class: MyList class.
 -	You will implement to mimic the behaviour of List class and in doing so, apply your good principles of practice, and learn through the process.
 -  You will extend the behaviour of List class and create your own version of the implementation. 
-	Construct code: use types, create variables, design methods and code constructs, and design class.
  
You are provided with:
-	A Console application (MyList) that includes: 
  -	‘MyList.cs’: This class requires your implementation. In implementing this class, you are encouraged to consider good practice for code design. Good consideration needs to be given to method design, sensible use of types and variables, and good code construct. Good and sensible OO practice is encouraged. 
  -	‘Test.cs’: This file contains tests that your implementation must pass with expected outcomes. Expected outcomes are captured in ‘ExpectedOutput.txt’ – see below.  You are not to make changes to ‘Test.cs’. Note that ‘Test.cs’ is not intended to be rigorously testing all possible sensible practices. These tests must be used as helpful guidance and you are expected to apply results of your own investigations and enquiries, over and above these tests.  
  -	‘Program.cs’: You are not to make changes to this file.
  -	‘ExpectedOutput.cs’: This is the expected output of application of tests and execution of your implementation. Use this as reference.
  -  ASCII Reference.txt’: C# compares using the ASCII values. This is to be used a reference.
**Task**
-	Download ‘MyList’ solution and implement ‘MyList.cs’ to pass tests in ‘Test.cs’.
-	In the solution, there are two sets of tests for testing generic implementation of the class (in GCP namespace) and for testing implementation of the class for type string (in SCP namespace). You are advised to tackle the problem in two stages:
o	Stage 1: Implement MyList class to work for string type (non-Generic implementation)
o	Stage 2: Convert ‘stage 1’ to a Generic implementation
o	Note: Where applicable, if implementation is not generic, it will be subject to reduction of mark by 20%
-	Zip ‘MyList’ top solution folder and submit to the submission point on BB.
